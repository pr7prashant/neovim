# A Basic Stable IDE config for Neovim

This repo is my personal neovim config. The neovim and plugins are pinned to a versions to avoid breaking changes. In this repo I will try to tag configs as newer version of neovim releases.

## Install Neovim 0.8

You can install Neovim with your package manager e.g. brew, apt, pacman etc.. but remember that when you update your packages Neovim may be upgraded to a newer version.

If you would like to make sure Neovim only updates when you want it to than I recommend installing from source:

**NOTE** Verify the required [build prerequisites](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Building-Neovim#build-prerequisites) for your system.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/neovim/neovim.git
cd neovim
git checkout release-0.8
make CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
sudo make install
```

## Install the config

Make sure to remove or move your current `nvim` directory

```sh
git clone https://github.com/pr7prashant/neovim.git ~/.config/nvim
```

Run `nvim` and wait for the plugins to be installed

**NOTE** (You will notice treesitter pulling in a bunch of parsers the next time you open Neovim)

**NOTE** Checkout this file for some predefined keymaps: [keymaps](https://github.com/LunarVim/nvim-basic-ide/blob/master/lua/user/keymaps.lua)

## Get healthy

Open `nvim` and enter the following:

```
:checkhealth
```

You'll probably notice you don't have support for copy/paste also that python and node haven't been setup

So let's fix that

First we'll fix copy/paste

- On mac `pbcopy` should be builtin

- On Ubuntu

  ```sh
  sudo apt install xsel # for X11
  sudo apt install wl-clipboard # for wayland
  ```

Next we need to install python support (node is optional)

- Neovim python support

  ```sh
  pip install pynvim
  ```

- Neovim node support

  ```sh
  npm i -g neovim
  ```

We will also need `ripgrep` for Telescope to work:

- Ripgrep

  ```sh
  sudo apt install ripgrep
  ```

Install Lazygit

- Ubuntu

```sh
LAZYGIT_VERSION=$(curl -s "https://api.github.com/repos/jesseduffield/lazygit/releases/latest" | grep '"tag_name":' |  sed -E 's/.*"v*([^"]+)".*/\1/')
```

```sh
curl -Lo lazygit.tar.gz "https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/releases/latest/download/lazygit_${LAZYGIT_VERSION}_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz"
```

```sh
sudo tar xf lazygit.tar.gz -C /usr/local/bin lazygit
```

```sh
lazygit --version
```

- Mac (Homebrew)

```
brew install jesseduffield/lazygit/lazygit
```

**NOTE** make sure you have [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed, I recommend a node manager like [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm).

## Fonts

I recommend using the following repo to get a "Nerd Font" (Font that supports icons)

[getnf](https://github.com/ronniedroid/getnf)

## Configuration

### LSP

To add a new LSP

First Enter:

```
:Mason
```

and press `i` on the Language Server you wish to install

Next you will need to add the server to this list: [servers](https://github.com/LunarVim/nvim-basic-ide/blob/0e65f504f634026f5765ce6a092612d385d6306d/lua/user/lsp/mason.lua#L1)

Note: Builtin LSP doesn't contain all lsps from [nvim-lspconfig](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/master/doc/server_configurations.md#terraform_lsp).

If you want to install any from there, for example terraform_lsp(which adds more functionality than terraformls, like complete resource listing),

1. You can add the lsp name in [mason lsp block](https://github.com/LunarVim/nvim-basic-ide/blob/f03955dc1e5879164f9229d44d98ca81a948cbfb/lua/user/lsp/mason.lua#L1-L10)

```lua
-- lua/usr/lsp/mason.lua
local servers = {
	"sumneko_lua",
	"cssls",
	"html",
	"tsserver",
	"pyright",
	"bashls",
	"jsonls",
	"yamlls",
  "terraform_lsp" -- New LSP
}
```

2. Manually install the binary of the lsp and put it in your path by downloading the binary or through your package manager. For terraform_lsp [example](https://github.com/juliosueiras/terraform-lsp/releases)

### Formatters and linters

Make sure the formatter or linter is installed and add it to this setup function: [null-ls](https://github.com/LunarVim/nvim-basic-ide/blob/0e65f504f634026f5765ce6a092612d385d6306d/lua/user/lsp/null-ls.lua#L12)

**NOTE** Some are already setup as examples, remove them if you want

### Plugins

You can install new plugins here: [plugins](https://github.com/LunarVim/nvim-basic-ide/blob/0e65f504f634026f5765ce6a092612d385d6306d/lua/user/plugins.lua#L45)
